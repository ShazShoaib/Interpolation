# Interpolation
Lagrange and cubic spline interpolation techniques in python. 

The code takes a function and approximates it using the lagrange and cubic spline algorithm and creates graphs for comparison, it also creates a text file for Newtons Divided Difference.

The function asks for the following input:\
The function to approximate\
The Upper and Lower bounds of the function (The min and max x values)\
The number of points to consider for approximation (The number of points the algorithms utilize, these are evenly spread)

The code can be altered to use with actual data instead of dummy data using a function
